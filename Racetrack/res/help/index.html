			After choosing those positions you can only increase or decrease your velocity by plus/minus one in each direction based on your previous velocity. Keep this in mind if you are getting to fast.

				The next possible locations will be shown on the grid. Only those locations are valid moves and can be performed. Any location outside the track or the current location of another player isn't a valid move.

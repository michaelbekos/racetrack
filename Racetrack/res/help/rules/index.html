				For the starting positions players are asked in the opposite direction as they later play in the game.
				Meaning, the last player in the game sets his start position first and the first player as the last one followed by his first move.
			</li>
			<li>
				During each move, a player can accelerate or decelerate in each dimension by plus or minus one.
				This results in a 3x3 matrix where a player can move next and the center of this matrix represents no change in speed.
			</li>
			<li>
				The goal of this game is, to be the first player who crosses the finish line at the end of the track.
				You will loose if you crash into one of the track boundaries. During each game you had a specific amount of time for each move, 
				based on the play mode selected; if the timer runs out of time you will be moved automatically. Therefore you will lose as well, 
				if you were moved automatically and crashed into someone else's car. If you not moved automatically you can not set your next move
				on someone else's position! <br>	
				On the other hand, you will win if you are the only player left in the game or by crossing the finish line.
